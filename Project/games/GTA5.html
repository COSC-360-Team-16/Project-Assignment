        <p>The open-world design lets players freely roam San Andreas, which includes an open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos (based on Los Angeles). Players control a silent protagonist in their journey to become a prominent crime figure, building up their own syndicate as they complete increasingly difficult tasks. Set both months before and a few years after the single-player campaign,[b] Grand Theft Auto Online comprises cooperative missions where multiple players complete tasks to advance the narrative. The game also features numerous side missions and events, including the more advanced "Heists", and various businesses that players can purchase with in-game money to generate income.</p>
