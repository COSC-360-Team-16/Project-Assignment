        <p>Ghostrunner is co-produced by 3D Realms and co-developed by Slipgate Ironworks. As Jack the Ghostrunner, the player must traverse dangerous environments by dashing, jumping, wall-running, and grappling. The player will also encounter enemies, which must be handled carefully, as both enemies and the player can be killed in one hit. Jack can use a mechanic called Sensory Boost, allowing him to slow down time and dodge and deflect bullets in midair. As the player progresses through the story, they will unlock new abilities and upgrades, which they can apply using tetramino-like pieces on a grid system.</p>
