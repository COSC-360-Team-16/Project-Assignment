            <p>A staple of the series, MyCareer, returns as one of the available game modes. MyCareer is a career mode in which the player creates their own customizable basketball player and plays through their basketball career. Players may make a male or female player, although female is only available on next-gen consoles. The Neighborhood also returns to MyCareer, as 2K Beach, in which players can customize their wardrobe, get haircuts and tattoos, and purchase boosts. They can also do their workouts and run drills to improve their attributes at their current team's practice facility. Progress in MyCareer may not carry over across generations, due to some changes made exclusively for next-gen.</p>

            <p>Up to 60 players control jelly bean-like creatures and compete against each other in a series of challenges, such as obstacle courses or tag. Many different courses have been added since the game was first released; the minority are team-based, while many require not falling into lava on a spinning, floating platform with obstacles designed to knock players in and waiting for a specified number of others to be eliminated, but most are obstacle courses that involve players racing to get to the finish line as soon as possible, lest they are annihilated—starting at 40, there is a limited number of players that can qualify, and with each round as the game progresses, the number lowers, eventually getting down to one, the player who is crowned the winner.</p>

            <h2 id='postheader'>Overcooked2</h2>
            <p>Overcooked 2 (stylised as Overcooked! 2) is a cooperative cooking simulation video game developed by Team17 alongside Ghost Town Games, and published by Team17. The sequel to Overcooked!, it was released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on August 7, 2018. Overcooked: All You Can Eat, a compilation game that includes both Overcooked and Overcooked 2, was released for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <img id="postimg" src="images/OC2.jpg" alt="Cyberpunk2077"></a>
            <p>In the cooking simulator game Overcooked 2, teams of up to four players cooperatively prepare and cook orders in absurd restaurants. Players gather, chop, and cook ingredients, combine them on plates, serve dishes, and wash dishes. Between coordinating short orders and bumping into each other's characters, the game tends to overwhelm. The sequel builds atop the original game, which was released in 2016, with new interactive levels, restaurant themes, chef costumes, and recipes. Some levels have moving floors and other obstacles that complicate the cooking process, including portals, moving walkways, and impassable fires. Other levels transition between settings and recipes, such as one that begins with preparing salads in a hot air balloon and ends crash-landed in a sushi kitchen. The sequel introduces ingredient tossing, such that players can throw items to another chef or pot from far away, and online multiplayer, in which teams can connect either across a local wireless network or through online matchmaking.</p>
