        <p>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is a platform battle royale game developed by Mediatonic and published by Devolver Digital. It was released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 on 4 August 2020. The game is planned for release on Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in mid 2021.</p>

        <p>Up to 60 players control jelly bean-like creatures and compete against each other in a series of challenges, such as obstacle courses or tag. Many different courses have been added since the game was first released; the minority are team-based, while many require not falling into lava on a spinning, floating platform with obstacles designed to knock players in and waiting for a specified number of others to be eliminated, but most are obstacle courses that involve players racing to get to the finish line as soon as possible, lest they are annihilatedâ€”starting at 40, there is a limited number of players that can qualify, and with each round as the game progresses, the number lowers, eventually getting down to one, the player who is crowned the winner.</p>
